This bot is running on Twitter and you can call it mentioning 
@BaixaIssoo in any video/gif.

To practice my coding skills i did prefer don't use any twitter library, i only used Jackson to parse the jsons.
To manage database operations i used DAO's.

Also, i developed an website to show all the orders attended by this bot.
You can look the other repository here: https://github.com/matheusmaniero/BaixaIssooWebSite
Website: https://baixaissoo.up.railway.app/

Both, bot and website is running on Railway.
